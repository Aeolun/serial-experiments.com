<p>I hate writing, so I figured I'd force myself to so to some extend anyway, by at least giving myself a platform to do so.</p>
<p>I'm currently employed by SpringerNature, which used to be Nature Publishing Group, but we merged, and the brand has become unrecognizable to most people in Japan.

<p>The other things I'm working on at the moment are <a href="https://chronolog.us">Chronolog</a>, an application to keep track of the work you are doing during the day, and <a href="https://98clicks.com">98Clicks</a>, which is a news website with news from all over the world on the same page. I'm trying to revive a website I build in the past, <a href="http://www.evemarketeer.com">evemarketeer.com</a>, out of nostalgia.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
