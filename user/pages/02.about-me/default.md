title: 'About Me'
---

My name is Bart Riepe. I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur. I build software and products, and I'm hoping to become great at building companies sometime in the future.

I hate writing, but I need to get good at it. So I figured I'd start keeping track of my progress towards a useful company by writing about it.

I'm currently employed by SpringerNature, which used to be Nature Publishing Group, but we merged, and the brand has become unrecognizable to most people in Japan. I also run a consulting business under the same name as this website, Serial Experiments (previously Coronum Webdevelopment), but am not actively finding clients any longer.

The other things I'm working on at the moment are [Chronolog](https://chronolog.us), an application to keep track of the work you are doing during the day, and [98Clicks](https://98clicks.com), which is a news website with news from all over the world on the same page. I'm trying to revive a website I build in the past, [evemarketeer.com](http://www.evemarketeer.com), out of nostalgia.
