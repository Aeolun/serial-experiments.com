<p>I hate writing, but I need to get good at it. So I figured I'd start keeping track of my progress towards a useful company by writing about it.</p>
<p>I'm currently employed by SpringerNature, which used to be Nature Publishing Group, but we merged, and the brand has become unrecognizable to most people in Japan. I also run a consulting business under the same name as this website, Serial Experiments (previously Coronum Webdevelopment), but am not actively finding clients any longer.</p>
<p>The other things I'm working on at the moment are <a href="https://chronolog.us">Chronolog</a>, an application to keep track of the work you are doing during the day, and <a href="https://98clicks.com">98Clicks</a>, which is a news website with news from all over the world on the same page. I'm trying to revive a website I build in the past, <a href="http://www.evemarketeer.com">evemarketeer.com</a>, out of nostalgia.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
